# Title: Implement Push-up Tutorial System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive push-up tutorial system that provides guidance on various push-up techniques, including detailed explanations, animations, and multi-language support.
# Details:
1. Create a database or data structure to store information for 10 different push-up types:
   - Standard, Knee, Incline, Wide Grip, Diamond, Decline, Clap, Archer, Pike, and One-arm
   - Include fields for name, description, difficulty level, target muscles, and common mistakes

2. Implement a user interface for the tutorial system:
   - Design a list view of all push-up types, categorized by difficulty (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Extreme)
   - Create detailed view pages for each push-up type
   - Add a "Tutorial" button on the home screen for easy access

3. For each push-up type, develop:
   - Step-by-step instructions (starting position → movement → breathing technique)
   - Animated illustrations or videos demonstrating proper form
   - Written explanations of benefits and target muscles
   - List of common mistakes and how to correct them

4. Implement a system for displaying encouraging messages in a "Gigachad style"

5. Create an internationalization system:
   - Support for Korean and English languages
   - Implement language switching functionality
   - Translate all content, including push-up descriptions, instructions, and UI elements

6. Design and implement navigation between the home screen, push-up list, and individual tutorial pages

7. Ensure consistent styling with the rest of the app (refer to Task 24 for theming guidelines)

8. Optimize performance for smooth animations and transitions between screens

9. Implement accessibility features for users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader support, adjustable text sizes)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test data structure/database for correct storage and retrieval of push-up information
   - Verify internationalization functions for proper translation of content

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test navigation flow from home screen to tutorial list to individual push-up pages
   - Verify that all push-up types are displayed correctly in the list view
   - Check that difficulty categorization is working as expected

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Ensure all animations and illustrations are rendering correctly
   - Test responsiveness of the UI on different screen sizes
   - Verify that the "Gigachad style" encouraging messages are displayed appropriately

4. Localization Testing:
   - Switch between Korean and English languages and verify all content is correctly translated
   - Check for any layout issues caused by text length differences between languages

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use screen reader to navigate through the tutorial system
   - Test with different text sizes to ensure readability

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct sessions with users of varying fitness levels to gather feedback on the tutorial system
   - Verify that the instructions and animations are clear and easy to follow

7. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load times for the tutorial list and individual push-up pages
   - Check for any lag or stuttering in animations

8. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test the tutorial system on various devices and OS versions

9. Error Handling:
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed if content fails to load

10. Regression Testing:
    - Ensure the new tutorial system doesn't negatively impact existing app functionality
