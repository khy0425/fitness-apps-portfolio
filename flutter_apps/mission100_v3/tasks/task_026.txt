5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use screen reader to navigate through the tutorial system
   - Test with different text sizes to ensure readability

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct sessions with users of varying fitness levels to gather feedback on the tutorial system
   - Verify that the instructions and animations are clear and easy to follow

7. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load times for the tutorial list and individual push-up pages
   - Check for any lag or stuttering in animations

8. Compatibility Testing:
