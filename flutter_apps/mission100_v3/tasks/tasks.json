Spacing and Layout Validation:\n   - Create a visual reference grid to verify consistent spacing across devices\n   - Compare screenshots from different devices to ensure proportional scaling\n   - Verify that UI elements maintain proper relationships regardless of screen size\n   - Check that no elements overlap or clip inappropriately on any tested configuration\n\n4. Safe Area Compliance:\n   - Test on devices with notches, punch holes, and other screen irregularities\n   - Verify content remains fully visible and properly padded in all safe area scenarios\n   - Test with system UI both visible and hidden to ensure proper adaptation\n   - Confirm that interactive elements remain accessible when near screen cutouts\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Monitor frame rates during layout changes (orientation shifts, app resuming)\n   - Verify that responsive calculations don't cause jank or stuttering\n   - Test memory usage across different device configurations\n   - Ensure smooth transitions between different layout states\n\n6. Automated Testing:\n   - Implement Flutter widget tests that simulate different screen sizes\n   - Create golden image tests for key screen configurations\n   - Set up integration tests that run through the workout flow on different virtual devices\n   - Document all test scenarios and expected outcomes in the test plan",

        "details": "1. Implement immediate data persistence:\n   - Modify the WorkoutService to save each completed set to the database immediately.\n   - Use a transaction to ensure data integrity when saving multiple related entities.\n   - Example: \n     ```dart\n     Future<void> saveCompletedSet(WorkoutSet set) async {\n       await database.transaction((txn) async {\n         await txn.insert('workout_sets', set.toMap());\n         await txn.update('workouts', {'last_updated': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()}, where: 'id = ?', whereArgs: [set.workoutId]);\n       });\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. Implement app lifecycle monitoring:\n   - Use Flutter's WidgetsBindingObserver to detect app state changes.\n   - In the main app widget, override the didChangeAppLifecycleState method.\n   - When the app is about to be terminated (AppLifecycleState.detached), trigger a final save of all pending data.\n\n3. Utilize SharedPreferences for temporary data storage:\n   - Store the current workout state (workout ID, current exercise, set number) in SharedPreferences.\n   - Update this information after each set completion and when switching exercises.\n   - Example:\n     ```dart\n     Future<void> saveWorkoutProgress(int workoutId, int exerciseIndex, int setNumber) async {\n       final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\n       await prefs.setInt('current_workout_id', workoutId);\n       await prefs.setInt('current_exercise_index', exerciseIndex);\n       await prefs.setInt('current_set_number', setNumber);\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. Implement workout resumption functionality:\n   - On app startup, check SharedPreferences for any saved workout state.\n   - If a saved state exists, prompt the user to resume the workout or start a new one.\n   - Implement a WorkoutResumptionService to handle the logic of restoring the previous workout state.\n\n5. Develop workout state restoration logic:\n   - Create a method to reconstruct the workout state from the database and SharedPreferences data.\n   - Fetch completed sets for the saved workout ID and rebuild the workout progress.\n   - Example:\n     ```dart\n     Future<WorkoutState> reconstructWorkoutState() async {\n       final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\n       final workoutId = prefs.getInt('current_workout_id');\n       if (workoutId == null) return null;\n       \n       final completedSets = await database.query('workout_sets', where: 'workout_id = ?', whereArgs: [workoutId]);\n       // Reconstruct workout state using completedSets and other saved data\n       // ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. Update the UI to support workout resumption:\n   - Modify the WorkoutScreen to accept a reconstructed workout state.\n   - Implement a dialog or screen to prompt users about resuming their workout.\n\n7.

UI Tests:\n   - Verify that the workout resumption prompt appears correctly when applicable.\n   - Test navigation and state management when resuming a workout vs. starting a new one.\n\n4. Edge Case Testing:\n   - Test behavior when the app is terminated between exercises or during rest periods.\n   - Verify correct handling of multiple workouts in progress (e.g., if the app is force-closed multiple times).\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure the time taken to save data after each set completion.\n   - Evaluate any potential impact on UI responsiveness during data saving operations.\n\n6. Stress Testing:\n   - Simulate rapid set completions and app terminations to ensure data integrity.\n\n7. Compatibility Testing:\n   - Verify functionality across different devices and OS versions.\n\n8. Data Integrity Checks:\n   - After simulated crashes, verify that the reconstructed workout state matches the expected state based on completed sets.\n\n9. Error Handling Tests:\n   - Simulate database errors or SharedPreferences failures to ensure graceful error handling.\n\n10.

Achievement Animation Implementation:\n   - Modify `workout_screen.dart` to add visual animation effects when achievements are unlocked\n   - Implement confetti animation using the `confetti` package:\n     ```dart\n     // Add to pubspec.yaml\n     dependencies:\n       confetti: ^0.7.0\n     \n     // In workout_screen.dart\n     final ConfettiController _confettiController = ConfettiController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2));\n     \n     // Initialize in initState()\n     @override\n     void initState() {\n       super.initState();\n       _confettiController = ConfettiController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2));\n     }\n     \n     // Dispose properly\n     @override\n     void dispose() {\n       _confettiController.dispose();\n       super.dispose();\n     }\n     \n     // Trigger on achievement unlock\n     void _showAchievementAnimation() {\n       _confettiController.play();\n       HapticFeedback.mediumImpact(); // Add haptic feedback\n     }\n     ```\n   \n   - Add a confetti widget to the UI:\n     ```dart\n     ConfettiWidget(\n       confettiController: _confettiController,\n       blastDirectionality: BlastDirectionality.explosive,\n       particleDrag: 0.05,\n       emissionFrequency: 0.05,\n       numberOfParticles: 20,\n       gravity: 0.1,\n       colors: const [Colors.green, Colors.blue, Colors.pink, Colors.orange],\n     )\n     ```\n\n2. Modify the achievement tracking logic to trigger animations:\n   - Update the `checkAchievements` method call to include a callback for animation:\n     ```dart\n     achievementService.checkAchievements(\n       pushUpCount: totalReps,\n       workoutDuration: sessionDuration,\n       onAchievementUnlocked: (achievement) {\n         _showAchievementAnimation();\n         _showAchievementToast(achievement.title);\n       },\n     );\n     ```\n\n3. Add a toast notification for immediate feedback:\n   ```dart\n   void _showAchievementToast(String achievementTitle) {\n     Fluttertoast.showToast(\n       msg: \"Achievement Unlocked: $achievementTitle\",\n       toastLength: Toast.LENGTH_LONG,\n       gravity: ToastGravity.TOP,\n       backgroundColor: Colors.green,\n       textColor: Colors.white,\n       fontSize: 16.0\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Enhance the workout completion dialog with weekly progress:\n   - Create a new widget `WeeklyProgressIndicator` to display progress:\n     ```dart\n     class WeeklyProgressIndicator extends StatelessWidget {\n       final int currentWeek;\n       final int totalWeeks = 6;\n       final int completedWorkoutsThisWeek;\n       final int totalWorkoutsPerWeek = 3;\n       \n       // Constructor and build method implementation\n       // Display a progress bar and checkmarks for completed workouts\n     }\n     ```\n   \n   - Update the workout completion dialog to include this widget:\n     ```dart\n     showDialog(\n       context: context,\n       builder: (context) => AlertDialog(\n         title: Text('Workout Complete!'),\n         content: Column(\n           mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\n           children: [\n             Text('Great job! You completed all sets.'),\n             SizedBox(height: 16),\n             WeeklyProgressIndicator(\n               currentWeek: currentWeek,\n               completedWorkoutsThisWeek: completedWorkoutsThisWeek,\n             ),\n           ],\n         ),\n         actions: [\n           // Dialog buttons\n         ],\n       ),\n     );\n     ```\n\n5. Add special animation for week completion:\n   - Detect when a user completes the last workout of the week\n   - Show an enhanced animation with more particles and duration\n   - Add congratulatory message specific to week completion\n\n6. Implement haptic feedback for different achievement levels:\n   - Minor achievements: `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()`\n   - Major achievements: `HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()`\n   - Week completion: `HapticFeedback.heavyImpact()`",
        "testStrategy": "To verify the correct implementation of achievement animations and weekly progress display:\n\n1. Test Achievement Animation:\n   - Complete a workout session that will trigger a known achievement\n   - Verify that the confetti animation appears on screen\n   - Confirm that haptic feedback occurs when the achievement is unlocked\n   - Check that the achievement toast notification appears with the correct title\n   - Test on different devices to ensure animation performance is acceptable\n\n2. Test Weekly Progress Display:\n   - Complete a workout and verify the completion dialog shows the weekly progress indicator\n   - Check that the progress bar accurately reflects the current week's progress\n   - Verify that completed workouts show checkmarks or other visual indicators\n   - Test scenarios with 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 workouts completed in a week\n   - Ensure the UI adapts properly to different screen sizes\n\n3. Test Week Completion Animation:\n   - Set up a test scenario where the next workout completes a week\n   - Complete the workout and verify the enhanced animation plays\n   - Confirm the congratulatory message for week completion appears\n   - Verify that the stronger haptic feedback occurs\n\n4. Edge Case Testing:\n   - Test achievement unlocking when multiple achievements are triggered simultaneously\n   - Verify animations work correctly when the app is in different states (foreground/background)\n   - Test with animations disabled in system settings to ensure fallback behavior\n   - Check behavior when haptic feedback is not available on the device\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure frame rate during animations to ensure smooth performance\n   - Test on lower-end devices to verify acceptable performance\n   - Ensure animations don't cause excessive battery drain\n\n6. Regression Testing:\n   - Verify that the existing achievement tracking functionality still works correctly\n   - Ensure workout completion logic continues to function as expected",
