# Task ID: 18
# Title: Workout Calendar Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the calendar view for tracking workout history
# Details:
1. Create a calendar widget using table_calendar or custom implementation
2. Implement features:
   - Visual indicators for completed workouts
   - Different markers for full vs. partial completion
   - Day selection for viewing workout details
   - Week/month view toggle
   - Current program day highlighting
3. Connect to WorkoutSession repository for data
4. Add animations for selection and transitions
5. Implement workout summary on day selection

Example implementation:
```dart
Widget buildWorkoutCalendar(List<WorkoutSession> sessions) {
  // Convert sessions to calendar event format
  // Configure calendar appearance and behavior
  // Add event handlers for day selection
  // Return configured calendar widget
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test calendar rendering with different data sets. Verify correct markers for workout states. Test day selection and detail view. Perform widget tests for key components.

# Subtasks:
