# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement AI-based Push-up Form Analysis System
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 44, 39
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an AI system using TensorFlow Lite to analyze user's push-up form in real-time through camera input, providing feedback on posture, counting repetitions, and offering form correction alerts.
# Details:
1. Set up TensorFlow Lite integration:
   - Add TensorFlow Lite dependencies to the project
   - Configure build settings for Android and iOS

2. Implement camera access and real-time video processing:
   - Use Flutter's camera plugin to access device camera
   - Set up a stream of video frames for processing

3. Integrate TensorFlow Lite model for pose estimation:
   - Select or train a suitable TensorFlow Lite model for human pose estimation
   - Implement model inference on video frames

4. Develop push-up specific analysis algorithms:
   - Create logic to identify key body points (shoulders, elbows, hips)
   - Implement angle calculations to determine proper form
   - Design algorithm to count repetitions based on up/down motion

5. Implement real-time feedback system:
   - Create visual overlays to show body alignment and form guidance
   - Develop audio feedback for rep counting and form corrections
   - Implement haptic feedback for immediate form alerts

6. Optimize performance:
   - Ensure smooth frame rates and responsive feedback
   - Implement background processing to avoid UI thread blocking

7. Integrate with existing achievement and statistics systems:
   - Store push-up session data (reps, form quality) in the database
   - Trigger achievement updates based on push-up performance
   - Include push-up data in workout statistics and charts

8. Design and implement UI for push-up analysis mode:
   - Create a dedicated screen for push-up form analysis
   - Display real-time metrics (rep count, form quality)
   - Add options to start/stop analysis and view summary

9. Implement error handling and edge cases:
   - Handle scenarios like poor lighting, partial visibility, multiple people
   - Provide user feedback for optimal camera positioning

10. Ensure privacy and data protection:
    - Implement secure handling of camera data
    - Add user consent flows for camera access and data collection

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test pose estimation algorithms with sample input data
   - Verify rep counting logic with various scenarios
   - Test form analysis calculations for accuracy

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify TensorFlow Lite model integration and inference
   - Test camera input processing and frame analysis pipeline
   - Ensure proper integration with achievement and statistics systems

3. UI Testing:
   - Verify correct rendering of pose overlay and feedback elements
   - Test responsiveness of UI during real-time analysis
   - Ensure accessibility of all UI elements in push-up analysis mode

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize frame processing speed
   - Test on various device types to ensure consistent performance
   - Verify battery usage is within acceptable limits

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct tests with users of varying fitness levels
   - Verify accuracy of form feedback and rep counting
   - Gather feedback on the usefulness and intuitiveness of the feature

6. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test in various lighting conditions and environments
   - Verify handling of partial occlusions and multiple people in frame
   - Test behavior when switching between apps or interrupting camera feed

7. Privacy and Security Testing:
   - Verify secure handling of camera data
   - Test user consent flows and data protection measures

8. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure new feature doesn't negatively impact existing functionality
   - Verify compatibility with achievement system and statistics tracking

9. Cross-platform Testing:
   - Test on both Android and iOS devices
   - Verify consistent behavior across different OS versions and device models
