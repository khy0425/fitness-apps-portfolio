# Task ID: 29
# Title: Task #29: Integrate Banner Advertisements in Tutorial Screens
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add banner advertisements to the push-up tutorial list screen and detail screen (including YouTube player) to generate additional revenue, implementing the same responsive structure as the workout screen.
# Details:
Implementation should include:

1. Banner Ad Integration:
   - Add Google Mobile Ads banner advertisements at the bottom of both the push-up tutorial list screen and detail screens
   - Ensure ads don't interfere with the YouTube player functionality on the detail screen
   - Use the same ad unit IDs structure as implemented in Task #27, but create new specific ad unit IDs for tutorial screens

2. Responsive Design Requirements:
   - Follow the responsive layout pattern established in Task #28 (workout screen)
   - Ensure proper ad display across all device sizes and orientations
   - Implement dynamic spacing that adjusts based on screen size
   - Handle safe area insets properly, especially on devices with notches or rounded corners

3. Technical Considerations:
   - Modify the tutorial screen layouts to accommodate the banner ads
   - Ensure the YouTube player resizes appropriately when ads are displayed
   - Implement ad loading with proper error handling and fallbacks
   - Add ad refresh logic with appropriate timing (e.g., every 60 seconds)
   - Ensure ads don't trigger when scrolling through tutorial content

4. UI/UX Considerations:
   - Maintain consistent UI/UX between workout and tutorial screens
   - Ensure ad banners don't obstruct important tutorial content
   - Add subtle visual separation between content and advertisements
   - Consider user experience when transitioning between screens with ads

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Lazy-load advertisements to prevent impact on initial screen loading
   - Monitor and optimize memory usage when displaying ads alongside video content
   - Implement ad caching where appropriate to improve performance

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify banner ads appear correctly on both tutorial list and detail screens
   - Confirm ads load properly and refresh at appropriate intervals
   - Test ad behavior when navigating between tutorial screens
   - Verify YouTube player functions correctly with ads present
   - Test ad loading states and error handling

2. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test on multiple physical devices with different screen sizes and aspect ratios
   - Use simulator/emulator testing for additional device coverage
   - Verify proper layout in both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Confirm ads maintain proper size and position when screen size changes
   - Test behavior when keyboard appears (if applicable)

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare app performance before and after ad integration
   - Monitor memory usage when ads are displayed alongside video content
   - Test scrolling performance on the tutorial list with ads present
   - Verify app responsiveness during ad loading and refresh cycles

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify ads appear correctly when navigating from other parts of the app
   - Test behavior when switching between tutorial list and detail views
   - Confirm proper ad behavior during app backgrounding and foregrounding

5. Ad Network Testing:
   - Verify test ads appear during development
   - Confirm production ads appear correctly when using release build
   - Test ad click-through behavior and return navigation
   - Verify ad impression tracking is working correctly

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure screen readers can properly navigate content with ads present
   - Verify content remains accessible when ads are displayed
