# Task ID: 17
# Title: Streak System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the consecutive workout streak tracking system
# Details:
1. Create a StreakService class
2. Implement logic to:
   - Track consecutive workout days
   - Handle streak breaks
   - Calculate longest streak
   - Provide streak status
3. Add streak milestone rewards
4. Implement streak recovery mechanics
5. Add streak notifications and reminders

Example implementation:
```dart
class StreakService {
  Future<void> updateStreak(DateTime workoutDate) async {
    // Get current streak from Progress repository
    // Check if workout maintains streak
    // Update streak count or reset if broken
    // Save updated streak information
  }
  
  Future<bool> isStreakAtRisk() async {
    // Check if user needs to work out today to maintain streak
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test streak calculation with various workout patterns. Verify streak breaks and recoveries are handled correctly. Test date boundary conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create StreakService class with basic streak tracking [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core StreakService class with methods to track consecutive workout days and handle streak breaks
### Details:
Create a StreakService class with the following methods: 1) updateStreak(DateTime workoutDate) to process new workouts and update streak count, 2) getCurrentStreak() to retrieve the current streak count, 3) private methods to determine if a workout maintains the streak based on date comparison. Implement logic to check if a new workout continues the streak (same day or consecutive day) or breaks it (gap in days). Store streak data using the Progress repository.

## 2. Implement streak statistics and status tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add functionality to track longest streak and provide current streak status information
### Details:
Extend the StreakService to track and store the user's longest streak achieved. Implement methods: 1) getLongestStreak() to retrieve the highest streak count, 2) getStreakStatus() to provide information about the current streak (active/inactive, days count), 3) isStreakAtRisk() to determine if the user needs to work out today to maintain their streak. Update the updateStreak method to maintain the longest streak record when appropriate.

## 3. Implement streak milestone rewards system [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Create a system to track streak milestones and provide rewards when they are achieved
### Details:
Implement a milestone reward system with: 1) Define milestone thresholds (e.g., 7, 30, 100 days), 2) Create a checkMilestones() method that identifies when a milestone is reached, 3) Implement a reward delivery mechanism that triggers when milestones are achieved, 4) Store unlocked rewards in user profile. Extend updateStreak() to check for milestones after updating the streak count.

## 4. Add streak recovery mechanics [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Implement functionality to allow users to recover broken streaks under certain conditions
### Details:
Create streak recovery features: 1) Implement a recoverStreak() method that allows restoring a broken streak within a configurable grace period (e.g., 1-2 days), 2) Add tracking for available recovery credits that users can earn or purchase, 3) Implement logic to determine when recovery is possible, 4) Create a getRecoveryStatus() method to inform users about recovery options. Update the streak calculation logic to consider recovered days.

## 5. Implement streak notifications and reminders [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.4
### Description: Add a notification system to remind users about maintaining their streak and alert them when streaks are at risk
### Details:
Implement streak notification features: 1) Create a scheduleStreakReminder() method to set up daily workout reminders, 2) Implement streakAtRiskNotification() to alert users when they need to work out today to maintain streak, 3) Add streakBrokenNotification() to inform users when a streak breaks and explain recovery options if available, 4) Create milestoneAchievedNotification() to celebrate when users reach streak milestones. Integrate with the device's notification system and implement background checking logic.
