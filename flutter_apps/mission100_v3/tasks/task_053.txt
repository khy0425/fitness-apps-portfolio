# Task ID: 53
# Title: Expand Language Support for Internationalization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 52
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement support for additional languages including Japanese, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Spanish, French, and German, with full translation, cultural context consideration, language-specific font optimization, and RTL language support.
# Details:
1. Set up internationalization framework:
   - Integrate the 'intl' and 'flutter_localizations' packages
   - Configure supported locales in the app's main.dart file
   - Set up a localization delegate to load translations

2. Create translation files:
   - Generate ARB (Application Resource Bundle) files for each supported language
   - Implement translations for all UI strings, error messages, and dynamic content
   - Ensure translations consider cultural context and idioms

3. Implement language selection:
   - Create a language selection screen in the app settings
   - Develop a mechanism to change the app's locale dynamically
   - Persist language preference using shared preferences or local storage

4. Font optimization:
   - Research and select appropriate fonts for each language
   - Implement dynamic font loading based on the selected language
   - Adjust text styles and layouts to accommodate different character sets

5. RTL (Right-to-Left) support:
   - Modify layouts to support both LTR and RTL text directions
   - Use Flutter's built-in RTL support (e.g., Directionality widget)
   - Test and adjust UI elements for proper RTL display

6. Localize app metadata:
   - Update app store descriptions, screenshots, and preview videos for each language
   - Localize app name and keywords for better discoverability

7. Implement a translation management system:
   - Set up a workflow for managing and updating translations
   - Consider using a translation management platform (e.g., Lokalise, Crowdin)

8. Cultural considerations:
   - Review and adapt images, icons, and color schemes for cultural appropriateness
   - Adjust date, time, and number formats for each locale

9. Testing and quality assurance:
   - Conduct thorough testing for each supported language
   - Verify proper rendering of all UI elements in different languages
   - Test language switching functionality and persistence

10. Documentation:
    - Update developer documentation to include internationalization guidelines
    - Create a guide for adding new languages in the future

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write tests for locale-specific string loading
   - Test date, time, and number formatting for each locale
   - Verify correct loading of language-specific assets

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test language switching functionality
   - Verify persistence of language preference across app restarts
   - Check proper loading of fonts for each language

3. UI Testing:
   - Conduct automated UI tests to verify layout integrity in all supported languages
   - Test RTL layout for appropriate languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew)
   - Verify text does not overflow or get cut off in any supported language

4. Manual Testing:
   - Perform visual inspection of UI elements in each language
   - Verify cultural appropriateness of images and icons
   - Test app performance and responsiveness with different languages

5. Localization Testing:
   - Review translations with native speakers for accuracy and cultural relevance
   - Check for missing translations or placeholder text
   - Verify correct pluralization rules are applied

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Test screen reader compatibility in all supported languages
   - Verify text scaling works correctly for all languages

7. Cross-platform Testing:
   - Test language support on both iOS and Android devices
   - Verify consistency of language rendering across different device sizes and resolutions

8. App Store Metadata Testing:
   - Review localized app store listings for accuracy and completeness
   - Test app store search using localized keywords

9. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing features and functionality work correctly in all languages
   - Verify that adding new languages hasn't broken any existing language support

10. Performance Testing:
    - Measure app launch times and memory usage with different language settings
    - Test network performance when downloading language-specific assets
