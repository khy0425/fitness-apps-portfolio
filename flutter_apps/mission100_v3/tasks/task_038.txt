# Task ID: 38
# Title: Task #38: Implement Settings Screen with Customization Options
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a comprehensive settings screen that allows users to customize the app experience, including notification preferences, theme selection, language options, data backup/restore functionality, and app information, with access via a new tab in the BottomNavigationBar.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Create a new Settings tab in the BottomNavigationBar:
   - Add an appropriate icon (gear or similar) for the settings tab
   - Update the navigation logic to handle the new tab
   - Ensure proper state management when switching between tabs

2. Design and implement the main Settings screen with the following sections:
   - Notification settings: Allow users to toggle various notification types (workout reminders, achievement notifications, etc.)
   - Theme settings: Provide options for light/dark mode and potentially custom theme colors that align with the GigaChad aesthetic
   - Language settings: Implement multi-language support with at least English and Korean options
   - Data backup/restore: Create functionality to export and import user data (workout history, achievements, personal settings)
   - App information: Display version number, developer information, terms of service, privacy policy, etc.

3. Technical considerations:
   - Use SharedPreferences or similar local storage for persisting user settings
   - Implement proper state management to reflect setting changes immediately across the app
   - Ensure all settings UI components follow the app's design language
   - Create reusable setting item widgets for consistent appearance
   - Implement proper navigation between main settings screen and sub-screens for detailed settings

4. Accessibility considerations:
   - Ensure all settings are accessible with proper labels for screen readers
   - Implement sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
   - Add appropriate semantics for assistive technologies

5. Integration with existing features:
   - Connect notification settings with the achievement/badge system from Task #37
   - Ensure theme settings properly affect all UI components throughout the app
   - Link data backup/restore with workout history and calendar data from Task #36

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following areas:

1. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify that the Settings tab appears correctly in the BottomNavigationBar
   - Confirm that all settings sections are displayed properly with appropriate icons and descriptions
   - Test navigation between main settings screen and sub-screens
   - Ensure UI adapts properly to different screen sizes and orientations
   - Verify that all text is properly localized when language settings are changed

2. Functional Testing:
   - Test each setting option to ensure it performs the expected action:
     - Notification toggles should enable/disable the appropriate notifications
     - Theme changes should immediately update the app's appearance
     - Language changes should update all text throughout the app
     - Data backup should create a valid export file
     - Data restore should correctly import previously exported data
   - Verify that settings persist after app restart

3. Integration Testing:
   - Confirm that notification settings properly affect the behavior of the achievement system
   - Verify that theme changes are applied consistently across all screens
   - Test that data backup/restore properly handles workout history and calendar data

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize any performance impact when switching between tabs
   - Ensure settings changes are applied without noticeable delay
   - Verify that data backup/restore operations handle large datasets efficiently

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all settings are properly announced
   - Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards
   - Confirm that all interactive elements are properly sized for touch targets

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct sessions with test users to gather feedback on the settings organization and usability
   - Verify that settings options are clear and intuitive to users
