# Task ID: 37
# Title: Task #37: Implement Achievement/Badge System for Workout Milestones
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive achievement system that rewards users with badges based on their workout accomplishments, including UI components, notification system, and themed badge designs that align with the GigaChad aesthetic.
# Details:
1. Database Implementation:
   - Create an Achievement model with fields for id, title, description, icon_path, criteria (e.g., consecutive_days, perfect_sets, total_exercises), threshold value, and unlocked status.
   - Design a UserAchievement junction model to track which achievements each user has earned and when.

2. Backend Services:
   - Implement AchievementService to handle badge logic and verification.
   - Create methods to check for achievements after workout completion.
   - Implement achievement triggers for various milestones:
     * First perfect set completion
     * 7-day consecutive workout streak
     * 100 exercises completed
     * 1000 total exercise repetitions
     * Other creative milestones fitting the GigaChad theme

3. UI Components:
   - Design a Badge component with locked/unlocked states
   - Create an Achievements screen showing all possible badges with progress indicators
   - Implement a badge showcase on the user profile
   - Design visually appealing badge icons matching the GigaChad theme

4. Notification System:
   - Implement in-app notifications when achievements are unlocked
   - Add celebratory animations/effects when a badge is earned
   - Create a notification history in the achievements section

5. Integration Points:
   - Hook achievement checks into the workout completion flow
   - Connect with the existing calendar system (Task #36) to track streaks
   - Ensure proper state management for real-time updates

6. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize achievement checks to avoid performance impacts
   - Consider batch processing for achievement verification
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed achievement data

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test Achievement model and relationships
   - Verify AchievementService logic for each achievement type
   - Test edge cases (e.g., streak breaks, achievement resets)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify achievement triggers properly fire after workout completion
   - Test the integration between workout tracking and achievement system
   - Ensure notifications appear correctly when achievements are unlocked

3. UI Testing:
   - Verify badge components render correctly in both locked/unlocked states
   - Test achievement screen layout on various device sizes
   - Verify animations and visual effects work as expected

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for unlocking each achievement type
   - Verify the full user journey from workout completion to achievement notification
   - Test achievement progress tracking accuracy

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure any performance impact during achievement checks
   - Test with a large number of achievements to ensure scalability
   - Verify notification system handles multiple simultaneous achievements

6. Manual Testing Checklist:
   - Complete a perfect set and verify the corresponding badge unlocks
   - Perform workouts for 7 consecutive days to test streak achievement
   - Complete 100+ exercises to test cumulative achievements
   - Verify all badge designs match the GigaChad theme
   - Check that all achievement descriptions are clear and accurate
