# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the workout summary screen shown after completing a workout
# Details:
1. Create a workout summary screen with:
   - Total push-ups completed
   - Comparison to target
   - Workout duration
   - Set-by-set breakdown
   - Achievement highlights
   - Share button for results
   - Next workout preview
2. Add animations for revealing statistics
3. Implement confetti effect for achievements
4. Add motivational message based on performance
5. Implement navigation to home or progress screen

Example implementation:
```dart
Widget buildWorkoutSummary(WorkoutSession session) {
  // Calculate summary statistics
  // Build UI components for each statistic
  // Add animations and interactive elements

}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test summary calculations with different workout data. Verify UI rendering on different screen sizes. Test share functionality. Perform widget tests for key components.
