# Task ID: 12
# Title: Chad Evolution System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the Chad character evolution system based on user progress
# Details:
1. Create a ChadEvolutionService class
2. Define the 7 evolution stages as specified in the PRD:
   - Stage 0: Sleep Cap Chad (Starting)
   - Stage 1: Basic Chad (Week 1 completion)
   - Stage 2: Coffee Chad (Week 2 completion)
   - Stage 3: Front-facing Chad (Week 3 completion)
   - Stage 4: Sunglasses Chad (Week 4 completion)
   - Stage 5: Glowing Eyes Chad (Week 5 completion)
   - Stage 6: Double Chad (Week 6 completion)
3. Implement logic to update Chad level based on progress
4. Add unlocking animations and notifications
5. Store and retrieve Chad images efficiently

Example method:
```dart
Future<void> checkAndUpdateChadLevel(Progress progress) async {
  // Calculate appropriate Chad level based on progress
  // Update user profile if level changed
  // Trigger notification/animation if evolved
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test evolution logic with different progress scenarios. Verify correct image loading for each stage. Test unlocking animations and notifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ChadEvolutionService class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ChadEvolutionService class with methods to manage Chad's evolution stages
### Details:

Implementation of ChadEvolutionService class completed:

- Created Chad Evolution model class (lib/models/chad_evolution.dart)
  - ChadEvolutionStage enum (7 evolution stages)
  - ChadEvolution data model (stage info, color themes, JSON serialization)
  - ChadEvolutionState status model (current state, evolution progress)

- Created ChadEvolutionService service class (lib/services/chad_evolution_service.dart)
  - Inherits ChangeNotifier for state management
  - Saves/loads evolution state via SharedPreferences
  - Evolution condition check and update logic (checkAndUpdateChadLevel)
  - Weekly evolution stage calculation
  - Evolution notification system (integrated with NotificationService)
  - Test/debug methods (manual evolution, reset, unlock all stages)
  - Evolution statistics and calculation of weeks needed for next evolution

Technical implementation details:
- 7-stage Chad evolution system (sleep cap → basic → coffee → front view → sunglasses → glowing eyes → double)
- Weekly evolution conditions (e.g., evolve to basic Chad after completing week 1)
- Stage-specific color theme system
- JSON serialization/deserialization support
- Error handling and debug logging
- Notification system integration (using achievement notifications)

Next steps: Test evolution logic development and integration with Progress model

## 2. Develop progress-based evolution logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement logic to update Chad's level based on user progress
### Details:
Create a method to calculate appropriate Chad level based on weekly progress. Implement the checkAndUpdateChadLevel method as specified in the example.
<info added on 2025-05-28T06:44:42.993Z>
Chad Evolution System implementation has been completed with the following components:

1. ChadEvolutionService integration:
   - Registered in main.dart as a Provider for global state management
   - Automatic initialization at app startup

2. Home screen integration (lib/screens/home_screen.dart):
   - Implemented Consumer<ChadEvolutionService> for real-time state updates
   - Added current Chad information display (name, image, description)
   - Applied stage-specific theme colors
   - Implemented evolution progress indicator (LinearProgressIndicator)
   - Added display for weeks remaining until next evolution
   - Special message for final stage achievement

3. Evolution progress calculation methods:
   - getEvolutionProgress(): Returns evolution progress as 0.0-1.0 value
   - getWeeksUntilNextEvolution(): Calculates weeks until next evolution
   - Added logic for handling final stage (Double Chad)

4. Technical implementation details:
   - Utilized themeColor property from Chad Evolution model
   - Implemented color theme progression (purple→blue→brown→green→black→red→gold)
   - Dynamic UI updates based on evolution state
   - Added error handling with safe default values

Note: Current week calculation is temporarily set to 0 and will be connected to actual Progress data in the next subtask.

## 3. Design and implement unlocking animations [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create animations for Chad's evolution and implement triggering mechanism
### Details:
Design visually appealing animations for each evolution stage. Implement a system to trigger these animations when Chad evolves.

# Chad Evolution Animation System Implementation

## Completed Work:

1. **ChadEvolutionAnimation Widget Creation** (`lib/widgets/chad_evolution_animation.dart`)
   - Multiple animation controllers (main, particle, scale, rotation)
   - Sequential animation execution system
   - Pre/post evolution Chad image transition (fade out/in)
   - Scale and rotation animation effects
   - Color transition animation (themeColor based)
   - Particle effect system (using CustomPainter)
