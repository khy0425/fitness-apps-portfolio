# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Watch App Integration for Apple Watch and Wear OS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a watch app for Apple Watch and Wear OS devices that allows users to start workouts and count push-ups, with real-time synchronization to the main app, heart rate monitoring, and a watch-specific UI.
# Details:
1. Set up development environments:
   - Configure Xcode for Apple Watch app development
   - Set up Android Studio for Wear OS app development

2. Design watch app UI:
   - Create a minimalist, easy-to-read interface for both platforms
   - Include screens for workout selection, push-up counter, and heart rate display
   - Ensure UI elements are optimized for small watch screens

3. Implement core functionality:
   - Develop push-up counting mechanism using accelerometer data
   - Integrate heart rate monitoring using respective APIs for each platform
   - Implement workout start/stop functionality

4. Real-time synchronization:
   - Set up Bluetooth communication between watch and phone
   - Implement data transfer protocol for sending workout data to main app
   - Ensure efficient battery usage during sync operations

5. Apple Watch specific implementation:
   - Use WatchKit framework for UI and functionality
   - Implement HealthKit integration for accurate health data

6. Wear OS specific implementation:
   - Use Wear OS API for UI components and sensors
   - Integrate with Google Fit for health data management

7. Error handling and offline mode:
   - Implement robust error handling for connectivity issues
   - Develop offline mode to store data locally when disconnected

8. Testing and optimization:
   - Conduct thorough testing on both platforms
   - Optimize for battery life and performance

9. Integration with main app:
   - Ensure seamless data flow between watch app and main app
   - Update main app to handle and display watch app data

10. Documentation:
    - Create user guide for watch app functionality
    - Document API and data structures for future maintenance

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for push-up counting algorithm
   - Test heart rate monitoring functions
   - Verify data synchronization methods

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test communication between watch app and main app
   - Verify data consistency across devices

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Conduct usability tests on both Apple Watch and Wear OS devices
   - Ensure readability and ease of use on small watch screens

4. Performance Testing:
   - Monitor and optimize battery consumption
   - Test app responsiveness during workouts

5. Connectivity Testing:
   - Simulate various network conditions to test sync functionality
   - Verify offline mode works correctly

6. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test on multiple Apple Watch and Wear OS device models
   - Ensure compatibility with different OS versions

7. Health Data Accuracy:
   - Validate heart rate data against known accurate devices
   - Verify push-up count accuracy with manual counting

8. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test behavior when storage is full
   - Verify app behavior during unexpected disconnections

9. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct beta testing with a group of users
   - Gather feedback on user experience and functionality

10. Regression Testing:
    - Ensure new watch app doesn't break existing main app functionality
    - Verify all features work correctly after each significant update
