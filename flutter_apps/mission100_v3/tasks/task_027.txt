# Task ID: 27
# Title: Task #27: UI Enhancement and Ad Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve the user interface by adding language toggle functionality, fixing text and layout issues, and integrating Google Mobile Ads with appropriate layout optimizations.
# Details:
This task involves several UI improvements and ad integration:

1. Language Toggle Implementation:
   - Add a language toggle switch/button that allows users to switch between Korean and English
   - Ensure all text elements throughout the app respond to language changes
   - Store language preference in local storage for persistence across app sessions

2. Button Text Improvements:
   - Change the text on the main CTA button from "Chad 여정 시작하기" to "Start for Chad"
   - Review and update any other buttons that may need text improvements for clarity and consistency

3. Workout Screen Overflow Fix:
   - Identify and fix the 79-pixel overflow issue on the workout screen
   - Ensure proper responsiveness across different device sizes
   - Test the fix on multiple screen dimensions to confirm resolution

4. Google Mobile Ads Integration:
   - Implement banner ads using the provided ID: ca-app-pub-1075071967728463/9498612269
   - Implement interstitial (full-screen) ads using the provided ID: ca-app-pub-1075071967728463/7039728635
   - Set up appropriate ad loading and display logic (e.g., show interstitial ads between workout sessions)
   - Implement test ads for development environment

5. Layout Optimization for Ads:
   - Adjust UI layouts to accommodate ad spaces without disrupting user experience
   - Ensure ads don't overlap with interactive elements
   - Optimize padding and margins around ad containers
   - Consider implementing ad-free spaces for critical user interactions

The implementation should maintain consistency with the existing app theme (Task #24) and work seamlessly with the push-up tutorial system (Task #26).

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the implementation:

1. Language Toggle Testing:
   - Verify toggle button works correctly in all app screens
   - Confirm all text elements update appropriately when language is changed
   - Test language persistence across app restarts
   - Verify proper fallback behavior if translations are missing

2. Button Text Testing:
   - Verify all button text changes have been implemented correctly
   - Check text alignment and sizing on various screen sizes
   - Ensure text is properly localized in both languages

3. Overflow Issue Testing:
   - Test workout screen on multiple device sizes and orientations
   - Verify no horizontal scrolling occurs due to overflow
   - Use layout inspection tools to confirm the 79-pixel overflow is resolved
   - Test with developer tools to simulate various screen dimensions

4. Ad Integration Testing:
   - Verify banner ads load and display correctly
   - Test interstitial ad triggers and display timing
   - Confirm ad IDs are correctly implemented
   - Test ad behavior when device is offline
   - Verify test ads appear in debug builds and real ads in release builds

5. Layout Optimization Testing:
   - Test UI with ads enabled on various device sizes
   - Verify no UI elements are obscured by ads
   - Test user interactions near ad placements
   - Perform usability testing to ensure ads don't significantly impact user experience

Additional testing:
   - Perform regression testing on existing features
   - Test app performance with ads enabled
   - Verify compliance with Google AdMob policies
   - Test ad behavior during different app states (background, foreground)
