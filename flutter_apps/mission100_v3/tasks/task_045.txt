# Task ID: 45
# Title: Fix PlatformException Error in Notification Settings for Android 12+
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the PlatformException error occurring in notification settings for Android 12+ devices by implementing proper permission handling for exact alarms and improving the NotificationService.
# Details:
1. Implement SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission request for Android 12+:
   - Add the necessary permission to the AndroidManifest.xml file:
     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
     ```
   - Create a method to check and request the permission:
     ```dart
     Future<bool> requestScheduleExactAlarmPermission() async {
       if (Platform.isAndroid) {
         final androidInfo = await DeviceInfoPlugin().androidInfo;
         if (androidInfo.version.sdkInt >= 31) {
           return await FlutterAlarmClock.requestScheduleExactAlarmPermission();
         }
       }
       return true;
     }
     ```

2. Improve NotificationService permission check logic:
   - Update the NotificationService to include the new permission check:
     ```dart
     class NotificationService {
       Future<bool> requestPermissions() async {
         final notificationPermissionGranted = await _requestNotificationPermission();
         final scheduleExactAlarmPermissionGranted = await requestScheduleExactAlarmPermission();
         return notificationPermissionGranted && scheduleExactAlarmPermissionGranted;
       }
       // ... other methods
     }
     ```

3. Implement fallback notification method:
   - Create a method to schedule inexact alarms as a fallback:
     ```dart
     Future<void> scheduleInexactNotification(int id, String title, String body, DateTime scheduledDate) async {
       final flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
       await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.schedule(
         id,
         title,
         body,
         scheduledDate,
         NotificationDetails(android: AndroidNotificationDetails('channel_id', 'channel_name')),
         androidAllowWhileIdle: true,
       );
     }
     ```

4. Add a dialog explaining the necessity of permissions:
   - Create a custom dialog widget:
     ```dart
     Future<void> showPermissionExplanationDialog(BuildContext context) async {
       return showDialog(
         context: context,
         builder: (BuildContext context) {
           return AlertDialog(
             title: Text('Permission Required'),
             content: Text('This app needs permission to schedule exact alarms for precise workout reminders. Without this permission, reminders may be delayed.'),
             actions: [
               TextButton(
                 child: Text('Cancel'),
                 onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false),
               ),
               TextButton(
                 child: Text('Grant Permission'),
                 onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true),
               ),
             ],
           );
         },
       );
     }
     ```

5. Implement functionality to navigate to app settings:
   - Add a method to open app settings:
     ```dart
     Future<void> openAppSettings() async {
       await openAppSettings();
     }
     ```

6. Implement conditional activation of notification features:
   - Update the notification scheduling logic:
     ```dart
     Future<void> scheduleWorkoutReminder(DateTime scheduledDate) async {
       final hasExactAlarmPermission = await requestScheduleExactAlarmPermission();
       if (hasExactAlarmPermission) {
         await scheduleExactNotification(/* parameters */);
       } else {
         await scheduleInexactNotification(/* parameters */);
       }
     }
     ```

7. Update the UI to reflect permission status:
   - Add a permission status indicator in the notification settings screen
   - Provide a button to request permissions or open app settings if permissions are denied

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the NotificationService:
   - Mock platform version to test Android 12+ specific logic
   - Verify that the correct permission request methods are called
   - Test the fallback to inexact notifications when permissions are denied

2. Integration test the notification scheduling flow:
   - Test the full flow of requesting permissions, scheduling notifications, and handling denials
   - Verify that exact alarms are used when permissions are granted, and inexact alarms when denied

3. UI tests for permission dialogs and settings:
   - Verify that the permission explanation dialog is displayed correctly
   - Test the navigation to app settings when the appropriate button is tapped

4. Manual testing on Android 12+ devices:
   - Verify that the SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission is correctly requested
   - Test scheduling notifications with and without the permission granted
   - Confirm that inexact notifications are used as a fallback when permission is denied

5. Edge case testing:
   - Test behavior when permissions are revoked after being initially granted
   - Verify proper handling of permission changes while the app is running

6. Accessibility testing:
   - Ensure all new UI elements related to permissions are accessible
   - Test screen reader compatibility for permission dialogs and settings

7. Regression testing:
   - Verify that existing notification functionality still works on pre-Android 12 devices
   - Confirm that other app features are not affected by the notification permission changes

### Description: Modify the NotificationService class to include the new SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission check alongside existing notification permissions.
### Details:
Update the requestPermissions method in NotificationService to check for both notification and SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permissions. Return a boolean indicating if all required permissions are granted.
<info added on 2025-05-30T12:48:02.133Z>
NotificationService has been fully updated for Android 12+ compatibility:

1. Replaced existing notification methods with safe versions:
   - scheduleDailyWorkoutReminder() now uses _safeScheduleNotification()
   - showSmartWorkoutReminder() checks permissions before scheduling
   - showAchievementNotification() includes permission checks and safety measures
   - All Chad evolution notification methods updated with safety checks
   - Workout completion and streak encouragement notifications also replaced with safe versions

2. Added hasPermission() method:
   - Maintains compatibility with existing code
   - Checks overall permission status from SharedPreferences

3. Improved permission request dialog system:
   - showPermissionRequestDialog() provides detailed permission explanations and UI
   - Special handling for Android 12+ SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission
   - Visual distinction with permission-specific icons and colors
   - User-friendly explanations and guidance messages

4. Integrated with settings_screen.dart:
   - Completely replaced _showPermissionRequestDialog() with new system
   - Added appropriate UI feedback based on permission request success/failure
   - Automatic notification setting activation when permissions are granted
   - Implemented error handling and fallback mechanisms

5. Resolved build.gradle dependency issues:
   - Added explicit Kotlin standard library
   - Added AndroidX core libraries
   - Added multidex support library
   - Cleaned up dependencies to resolve MainActivity.kt linter errors

All notification features now work safely on Android 12+ devices without PlatformException errors. When permissions are unavailable, immediate notifications are used as fallback to maintain user experience.

## 3. Implement fallback notification method [done]
### Dependencies: 45.2
### Description: Create a method to schedule inexact alarms as a fallback when exact alarm permission is not granted.
### Details:
Develop a scheduleInexactNotification method using FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin to schedule notifications with less precision when exact alarms are not possible.
<info added on 2025-05-30T12:50:06.106Z>
I've implemented a robust fallback notification system to handle Android 12+ permission constraints:

The scheduleInexactNotification() method now provides inexact notification scheduling when SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission is unavailable. It attempts exact scheduling for notifications within 30 minutes, uses periodic checking for longer delays, displays immediate notifications for past times, and implements a three-tier fallback system (exact → inexact → immediate).

The periodic check system (_schedulePeriodicCheck) starts checking 30 minutes before the target time using silent system notifications invisible to users, with SharedPreferences as a final fallback.

The SharedPreferences backup system includes:
- _scheduleSharedPreferencesCheck(): Stores notification data locally
- checkPendingNotifications(): Verifies and displays pending notifications when app starts/activates
- 7-day auto-cleanup for old notifications
- Secure data storage via JSON serialization

The _safeScheduleNotification method now uses the inexact notification system instead of immediate notifications when permissions are unavailable, with appropriate logging and error handling at each fallback stage.

HomeScreen integration calls checkPendingNotifications() in both initState and didChangeAppLifecycleState to automatically check for pending notifications at app launch and when returning to foreground.

This system ensures notifications still function on Android 12+ even without SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission, maintaining user experience while working around permission constraints.

## 4. Update UI and implement conditional notification activation [done]
### Dependencies: 45.2, 45.3
### Description: Modify the app's UI to reflect permission status and implement logic to use either exact or inexact notifications based on granted permissions.
### Details:
Add a permission status indicator in the notification settings screen. Create a scheduleWorkoutReminder method that checks permissions and calls either exact or inexact notification scheduling. Implement a dialog to explain permission necessity and provide options to request or open app settings.
