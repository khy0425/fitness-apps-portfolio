# Task ID: 39
# Title: Task #39: Implement Detailed Statistics and Charts with fl_chart Package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive visualization system using the fl_chart package to display user workout data through various chart types, including weekly/monthly progress graphs, time-based workout patterns, performance comparisons by level, and achievement trends.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Integration of the fl_chart package into the project dependencies.
2. Creation of a dedicated Statistics screen accessible from the main navigation.
3. Development of multiple chart components:
   - Line charts for weekly/monthly progress tracking
   - Bar charts for time-based workout patterns (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - Radar charts for comparing performance across different exercise categories
   - Pie charts for achievement completion rates
   - Progress indicators for goal completion trends

4. Implementation of filtering options to allow users to select different time periods (week, month, year).
5. Addition of interactive elements such as tooltips when tapping on data points.
6. Ensure responsive design that works across different screen sizes.
7. Implement caching mechanism to store chart data locally for offline viewing.
8. Create animations for chart transitions when changing between different visualization types.
9. Design consistent styling that matches the GigaChad aesthetic established in previous tasks.
10. Implement data processing utilities to transform raw workout data into chart-compatible formats.
11. Add export functionality to allow users to share their statistics as images.

The charts should dynamically update as new workout data is recorded, providing real-time feedback on user progress.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be conducted through the following approaches:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test data transformation functions that convert workout data to chart formats
   - Verify chart configuration parameters are correctly applied
   - Test filtering logic for different time periods

2. Widget Tests:
   - Verify charts render correctly with sample data
   - Test interactive elements like tooltips and filters
   - Ensure animations work as expected
   - Verify responsiveness by testing with different screen dimensions

3. Integration Tests:
   - Confirm charts update when new workout data is added
   - Test navigation between different chart types
   - Verify export functionality produces valid image files

4. Manual Testing:
   - Perform visual inspection of all chart types with various data scenarios
   - Test with both sparse and dense data sets
   - Verify performance with large datasets
   - Check accessibility features work with charts
   - Test on multiple physical devices to ensure consistent rendering

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for users to evaluate the intuitiveness of the charts
   - Gather feedback on visual clarity and information comprehension
   - Verify the charts effectively communicate progress and patterns

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure rendering time for complex charts
   - Test memory usage when displaying multiple charts
   - Verify smooth animations on lower-end devices
