# Task ID: 10
# Title: Workout Session Logic Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the logic for tracking and saving workout sessions
# Details:
1. Create a WorkoutSessionController class
2. Implement methods to:
   - Start a new workout session
   - Track completed reps for each set
   - Calculate total reps and workout duration
   - Mark sets and full workout as completed
   - Save workout data to database
3. Implement validation to ensure data integrity
4. Add logic to handle partial workout completion
5. Implement workout summary generation

Example method:
```dart
Future<void> completeSet(int setIndex, int completedReps) async {
  // Update current workout session with completed reps
  // Check if all sets are completed
  // Update database
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for workout session logic. Test set completion, workout completion, and data persistence. Test edge cases like partial workouts or missed workouts.
