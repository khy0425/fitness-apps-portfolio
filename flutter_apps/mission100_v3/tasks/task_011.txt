# Task ID: 11
# Title: Progress Tracking Screen Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the progress tracking screen with charts and statistics
# Details:
1. Create a progress screen with:
   - Weekly growth chart using fl_chart
   - Calendar view showing workout history
   - Total push-up count display
   - Chad evolution stage visualization
   - Completion percentage
2. Implement tab navigation for different stats views
3. Add filters for time periods (week, month, all time)
4. Implement data fetching from Progress repository
5. Add animations for chart transitions

Example chart implementation:
```dart
LineChart createWeeklyProgressChart(List<WeeklyProgress> data) {
  // Convert progress data to chart data points
  // Configure chart appearance and behavior
  // Return configured LineChart widget
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test chart rendering with different data sets. Verify calculations for statistics. Test UI on different screen sizes. Perform widget tests for key components.

## 2. Develop Calendar View for Workout History [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a calendar view showing the user's workout history
### Details:
Use a calendar widget (e.g., table_calendar), integrate with Progress repository to fetch workout dates, highlight days with completed workouts, add tap gesture for detailed view
<info added on 2025-05-27T19:12:15.140Z>
Implemented calendar view with workout history using table_calendar 3.1.2 package. Created TableCalendar<WorkoutSession> widget with workout event loader integration. Developed data management with _loadCalendarData() method to load all workout sessions and group them by date in _workoutEvents Map. Added _getWorkoutsForDay() method to retrieve workouts for specific dates.

Built interactive UI with green markers for completed workout days, highlighted current day, selected date indication, and dark/light theme support. Implemented detailed workout view for selected dates with _buildSelectedDayWorkouts() widget and workout session cards (_buildWorkoutSessionCard) showing completion status with color coding.

Each workout card displays week-day information, total pushup count, set count, and detailed records for completed sets with appropriate icons and color coding. Resolved all linter issues, properly utilized WorkoutSession model fields, and removed unnecessary variables. The implementation supports responsive design and accessibility features.

## 3. Create Statistics Display Section [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement displays for total push-up count, Chad evolution stage, and completion percentage
### Details:
Design and implement custom widgets for each statistic, fetch data from Progress repository, create Chad evolution stage visualization, calculate and display completion percentage
<info added on 2025-05-27T19:32:46.119Z>
Implemented comprehensive statistics dashboard with multiple card components:

1. Overall Statistics Card: Displays total pushups, completed sessions, average per session, and completion rate in a 2x2 grid with color-coded icons.

2. Chad Evolution Stage Card: Shows current Chad level with evolution image, progress bar to next level, and gold theme styling.

3. Weekly Performance Card: Summarizes recent 3-week performance with color-coded status indicators (perfect/good/needs improvement) and link to weekly growth tab.

4. Personal Records Card: Presents best records, best week, streak days, and average score in a 2x2 grid with unique colors and icons.

5. Reusable Components: Created _buildStatCard and _buildRecordItem for consistent display of statistics and records.
