# Title: Task #34: Fix Workout Screen Overflow and Add Banner Advertisement with Animation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the 137-pixel overflow issue on the workout screen by implementing a scrollable layout, and add a banner advertisement at the bottom with smooth animation effects to increase revenue.
# Details:
This task involves addressing the current overflow problem on the workout screen and adding a revenue-generating banner advertisement:

1. Overflow Resolution:
   - Identify the elements causing the 137-pixel overflow on the workout screen
   - Convert the current fixed layout to a scrollable layout (RecyclerView or ScrollView)
   - Ensure all workout content is accessible via vertical scrolling
   - Maintain the visual hierarchy and spacing of workout elements
   - Optimize scroll performance to prevent jank or stuttering

2. Banner Advertisement Implementation:
   - Add a banner advertisement container at the bottom of the workout screen
   - Integrate with the existing ad network SDK (AdMob, Facebook Audience Network, etc.)
   - Ensure the ad container has appropriate dimensions (typically 320Ã—50dp)
   - Implement proper ad loading and error handling
   - Make sure the ad doesn't interfere with critical workout functionality

3. Animation Effects:
   - Add a subtle fade-in animation when the banner ad loads
   - Implement a smooth transition when scrolling between workout content
   - Consider adding a subtle bounce effect at scroll boundaries
   - Ensure animations are performant and don't cause frame drops
   - Animation duration should be brief (300-500ms) to avoid disrupting the user experience

4. Layout Considerations:
   - Ensure the scrollable area and ad banner work correctly across all supported device sizes
   - Maintain appropriate padding/margins between workout content and the ad banner
   - Handle orientation changes properly
   - Ensure accessibility features work correctly with the new scrollable layout

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Monitor and optimize memory usage with the new scrollable layout
   - Implement view recycling if using RecyclerView
   - Lazy-load any images or heavy content as needed

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the implementation:

1. Overflow Resolution Testing:
   - Verify the workout screen displays correctly without overflow on multiple device sizes (small, medium, large screens)
   - Test scrolling functionality to ensure all content is accessible
   - Verify scroll performance is smooth with no stuttering or lag
   - Test with different content lengths to ensure the layout adapts appropriately
   - Verify that touch interactions work correctly within the scrollable area

2. Banner Advertisement Testing:
   - Verify the banner ad loads correctly and displays at the bottom of the screen
   - Test ad loading in different network conditions (strong, weak, offline)
   - Verify ad refresh functionality works as expected
   - Test ad click-through behavior to ensure it opens the expected destination
   - Verify ad impression tracking is working correctly

3. Animation Testing:
   - Verify all animations render smoothly at 60fps
   - Test animations on lower-end devices to ensure performance
   - Verify fade-in animation for the banner ad works correctly
   - Test scroll animations to ensure they feel natural and responsive
   - Verify animations don't interfere with user interactions

4. Cross-device Testing:
   - Test on at least 3 different Android versions (minimum supported version to latest)
   - Test on at least 3 different screen sizes and densities
   - Verify layout works correctly in both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Test with system font size changes (accessibility settings)

5. Performance Testing:
   - Monitor memory usage before and after implementation
   - Use Android Profiler to verify no memory leaks occur
   - Measure and compare frame rates during scrolling
   - Verify battery impact is minimal when using the scrollable workout screen

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify all existing workout screen functionality continues to work
   - Test integration with connected screens and features
   - Verify workout tracking and data recording functions work correctly
