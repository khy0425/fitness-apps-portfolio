# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement SQLite database schema based on the data models defined in the PRD
# Details:
1. Create database helper class for SQLite operations
2. Implement the following tables based on PRD data models:
   - user_profile (id, level, initial_max_reps, start_date, chad_level, reminder_enabled, reminder_time)
   - workout_session (id, date, week, day, target_reps, completed_reps, is_completed, total_reps, total_time)

   - weekly_progress (for tracking weekly stats)

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for database operations. Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting records for each table. Verify data integrity and relationships between tables.
