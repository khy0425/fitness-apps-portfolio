# Title: Add Achievement Animation Effects and Improve Weekly Progress Display
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 56
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement visual animation effects for achievement unlocks and enhance the weekly progress display after workout completion to provide better user feedback.
# Details:
This task involves adding visual feedback animations and improving the weekly progress display:

1. Achievement Animation Implementation:
   - Modify `workout_screen.dart` to add visual animation effects when achievements are unlocked
   - Implement confetti animation using the `confetti` package:
     ```dart
     // Add to pubspec.yaml
     dependencies:
       confetti: ^0.7.0
     
     // In workout_screen.dart
     final ConfettiController _confettiController = ConfettiController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2));
     
     // Initialize in initState()
     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       _confettiController = ConfettiController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2));
     }
     
     // Dispose properly
     @override
     void dispose() {
       _confettiController.dispose();
       super.dispose();
     }
     
     // Trigger on achievement unlock
     void _showAchievementAnimation() {
       _confettiController.play();
       HapticFeedback.mediumImpact(); // Add haptic feedback
     }
     ```
   
   - Add a confetti widget to the UI:
     ```dart
     ConfettiWidget(
       confettiController: _confettiController,
       blastDirectionality: BlastDirectionality.explosive,
       particleDrag: 0.05,
       emissionFrequency: 0.05,
       numberOfParticles: 20,
       gravity: 0.1,
       colors: const [Colors.green, Colors.blue, Colors.pink, Colors.orange],
     )
     ```

2. Modify the achievement tracking logic to trigger animations:
   - Update the `checkAchievements` method call to include a callback for animation:
     ```dart
     achievementService.checkAchievements(
       pushUpCount: totalReps,
       workoutDuration: sessionDuration,
       onAchievementUnlocked: (achievement) {
         _showAchievementAnimation();
         _showAchievementToast(achievement.title);
       },
     );
     ```

3. Add a toast notification for immediate feedback:
   ```dart
   void _showAchievementToast(String achievementTitle) {
     Fluttertoast.showToast(
       msg: "Achievement Unlocked: $achievementTitle",
       toastLength: Toast.LENGTH_LONG,
       gravity: ToastGravity.TOP,
       backgroundColor: Colors.green,
       textColor: Colors.white,
       fontSize: 16.0
     );
   }
   ```

4. Enhance the workout completion dialog with weekly progress:
   - Create a new widget `WeeklyProgressIndicator` to display progress:
     ```dart
     class WeeklyProgressIndicator extends StatelessWidget {
       final int currentWeek;
       final int totalWeeks = 6;
       final int completedWorkoutsThisWeek;
       final int totalWorkoutsPerWeek = 3;
       
       // Constructor and build method implementation
       // Display a progress bar and checkmarks for completed workouts
     }
     ```
   
   - Update the workout completion dialog to include this widget:
     ```dart
     showDialog(
       context: context,
       builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
         title: Text('Workout Complete!'),
         content: Column(
           mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
           children: [
             Text('Great job! You completed all sets.'),
             SizedBox(height: 16),
             WeeklyProgressIndicator(
               currentWeek: currentWeek,
               completedWorkoutsThisWeek: completedWorkoutsThisWeek,
             ),
           ],
         ),
         actions: [
           // Dialog buttons
         ],
       ),
     );
     ```

5. Add special animation for week completion:
   - Detect when a user completes the last workout of the week
   - Show an enhanced animation with more particles and duration
   - Add congratulatory message specific to week completion

6. Implement haptic feedback for different achievement levels:
   - Minor achievements: `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()`
   - Major achievements: `HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()`
   - Week completion: `HapticFeedback.heavyImpact()`

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of achievement animations and weekly progress display:

1. Test Achievement Animation:
   - Complete a workout session that will trigger a known achievement
   - Verify that the confetti animation appears on screen
   - Confirm that haptic feedback occurs when the achievement is unlocked
   - Check that the achievement toast notification appears with the correct title
   - Test on different devices to ensure animation performance is acceptable

2. Test Weekly Progress Display:
   - Complete a workout and verify the completion dialog shows the weekly progress indicator
   - Check that the progress bar accurately reflects the current week's progress
   - Verify that completed workouts show checkmarks or other visual indicators
   - Test scenarios with 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 workouts completed in a week
   - Ensure the UI adapts properly to different screen sizes

3. Test Week Completion Animation:
   - Set up a test scenario where the next workout completes a week
   - Complete the workout and verify the enhanced animation plays
   - Confirm the congratulatory message for week completion appears
   - Verify that the stronger haptic feedback occurs

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test achievement unlocking when multiple achievements are triggered simultaneously
   - Verify animations work correctly when the app is in different states (foreground/background)
   - Test with animations disabled in system settings to ensure fallback behavior
   - Check behavior when haptic feedback is not available on the device

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure frame rate during animations to ensure smooth performance
   - Test on lower-end devices to verify acceptable performance
   - Ensure animations don't cause excessive battery drain

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that the existing achievement tracking functionality still works correctly
   - Ensure workout completion logic continues to function as expected
