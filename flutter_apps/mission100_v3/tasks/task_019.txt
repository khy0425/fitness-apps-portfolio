# Task ID: 19
# Title: Data Backup and Restore Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement functionality to backup and restore user data
# Details:
1. Create a DataBackupService class
2. Implement methods for:
   - Creating a backup of all user data
   - Exporting backup to JSON file
   - Importing backup from JSON file
   - Restoring data from backup
3. Add file system access for storage
4. Implement backup scheduling
5. Add backup encryption (optional)

Example implementation:
```dart
class DataBackupService {
  Future<String> createBackup() async {
    // Fetch all user data from repositories
    // Convert to JSON format
    // Return JSON string or save to file
  }
  
  Future<bool> restoreFromBackup(String backupJson) async {
    // Parse backup JSON
    // Validate data integrity
    // Restore to repositories
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test backup creation and restoration with various data states. Verify data integrity after restore. Test file system operations. Test with corrupted or invalid backup data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create DataBackupService with Core Backup/Restore Methods [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the DataBackupService class with the core methods for creating backups and restoring from backups.
### Details:
Create a new DataBackupService class with two primary methods: createBackup() and restoreFromBackup(). The createBackup() method should collect all user data from repositories, serialize it to JSON format, and return the JSON string. The restoreFromBackup() method should take a JSON string, parse it, validate the data structure, and restore it to the appropriate repositories. Include proper error handling and validation.

## 2. Implement File System Operations for Backup Storage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add file system access capabilities to save backups to disk and load them from disk.
### Details:
Extend the DataBackupService to include methods for saving backups to files (exportBackupToFile) and loading backups from files (importBackupFromFile). Use platform-specific file system APIs or a cross-platform file access package. Implement proper error handling for file operations, including permission issues and disk space limitations. Create a consistent file naming convention that includes timestamps.

## 3. Add Backup Encryption and Security Features [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement encryption for backup files to secure user data.
### Details:
Add encryption capabilities to the backup service using a secure encryption algorithm (AES-256 recommended). Implement methods to encrypt backup data before saving to disk and decrypt when loading. Create a secure key management system that allows users to set a password for their backups. Store encryption keys securely, possibly using platform-specific secure storage options.

## 4. Implement Backup Scheduling System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a scheduling system that allows automatic backups at regular intervals.
### Details:
Develop a BackupScheduler class that can trigger backups at specified intervals (daily, weekly, etc.). Implement background task scheduling using platform-specific APIs or packages. Add user preferences for backup frequency and retention policy (how many backups to keep). Include notification capabilities to inform users about successful or failed backup operations.

## 5. Create User Interface for Backup Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface that allows users to manage backups, including manual backup creation, restoration, and schedule configuration.
### Details:
Design and implement UI screens for backup management, including: a main backup dashboard showing backup history and status, a backup creation screen with options for encryption, a restore screen for selecting and restoring backups, and a settings screen for configuring backup schedules and retention policies. Implement progress indicators for long-running backup/restore operations and clear error messages for failures.
