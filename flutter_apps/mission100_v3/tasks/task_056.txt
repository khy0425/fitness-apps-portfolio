# Status: pending

# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the achievement tracking issue in workout_screen.dart by correcting the method call from checkAndUpdateAchievements to checkAchievements and ensuring proper data transmission for push-up count and workout duration.
# Details:
This task involves fixing a critical bug in the achievement tracking system that prevents users from properly earning achievements after completing workouts. The implementation requires:

1. Locate and modify the method call in workout_screen.dart:
   - Find all instances where `checkAndUpdateAchievements` is being called
   - Replace with the correct method name `checkAchievements`
   - Ensure the method signature matches the implementation in the achievements service

2. Fix data transmission to the achievement checking system:
   - Identify where workout completion data is being processed
   - Ensure the push-up count (total reps completed) is correctly calculated and passed to the achievement checking method
   - Verify that workout duration is properly tracked from start to finish and passed to the achievement checking method
   - Check for any data type mismatches or formatting issues in the parameters

3. Review the achievement checking logic:
   - Ensure achievement conditions are being evaluated correctly
   - Verify that achievements are properly marked as completed when conditions are met
   - Check for any edge cases that might prevent achievements from triggering

4. Implementation example:
```dart
// Before (incorrect implementation)
void _completeWorkout() {
  // Other workout completion logic
  achievementService.checkAndUpdateAchievements(); // Wrong method name and missing parameters
}

// After (corrected implementation)
void _completeWorkout() {
  // Other workout completion logic
  final int totalPushups = _calculateTotalPushups();
  final Duration workoutDuration = _calculateWorkoutDuration();
  
  achievementService.checkAchievements(
    pushupCount: totalPushups,
    workoutDuration: workoutDuration,
  );
}
```

5. Add logging to verify data is being passed correctly:
   - Implement debug logging before and after the achievement check call
   - Log the values being passed to help with troubleshooting

# Test Strategy:
To verify this fix has been properly implemented:

1. Code Review:
   - Confirm all instances of `checkAndUpdateAchievements` have been replaced with `checkAchievements`
   - Verify parameter types and names match the method signature
   - Check that push-up count and workout duration calculations are accurate

2. Manual Testing:
   - Test achievement triggering with different workout scenarios:
     - Complete a workout with exactly the number of push-ups needed for an achievement
     - Complete a workout with duration matching a time-based achievement
     - Complete multiple workouts to trigger streak-based achievements
   - Verify achievements appear in the achievements screen after conditions are met
   - Test edge cases like very short workouts or workouts with modified rep counts

3. Debug Logging Verification:
   - Review logs to confirm correct data is being passed to the achievement checking method
   - Verify achievement conditions are being evaluated with the correct values

4. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure other workout functionality still works correctly
   - Verify workout history is still properly recorded
   - Check that workout statistics are still accurate

5. User Scenario Testing:
   - Complete a full workout flow from start to finish
   - Verify achievement notifications appear when conditions are met
   - Check the achievements screen to confirm newly unlocked achievements are displayed correctly
