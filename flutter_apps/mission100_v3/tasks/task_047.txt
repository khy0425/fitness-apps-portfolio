# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement Social Features for User Competition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 44, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a social system that allows users to add friends, compare push-up performance, and engage in friendly competition. This includes implementing friend lists, leaderboards, performance comparisons, and encouragement messaging features.
# Details:
1. Friend System:
   - Implement a FriendService to handle friend requests, acceptances, and list management
   - Create a Friend model with fields: userId, friendId, status (pending, accepted)
   - Add UI components for searching users, sending/accepting friend requests, and displaying friend lists

2. Leaderboard:
   - Develop a LeaderboardService to calculate and update user rankings based on push-up performance
   - Create a Leaderboard model to store user rankings, scores, and relevant statistics
   - Implement UI for displaying global and friend-only leaderboards with sorting options

3. Performance Comparison:
   - Extend the existing statistics system to allow comparison between friends
   - Create ComparisonService to fetch and process comparative data
   - Implement UI components for side-by-side stat comparison and progress charts

4. Encouragement Messaging:
   - Develop a messaging system for users to send pre-defined or custom encouragement messages
   - Create a Message model with fields: senderId, receiverId, content, timestamp
   - Implement UI for composing, sending, and displaying messages within the app

5. Firebase Integration:
   - Set up Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for storing social data
   - Implement Firebase Authentication for secure user identification
   - Use Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side operations like leaderboard updates

6. Privacy Settings:
   - Create privacy options for users to control visibility of their data
   - Implement PrivacyService to manage user privacy preferences

7. Notifications:
   - Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
   - Implement notification triggers for friend requests, leaderboard changes, and received messages

8. UI/UX Design:
   - Design and implement a "Social" tab in the main navigation
   - Create intuitive interfaces for all social features, ensuring consistency with existing app design

9. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement efficient data fetching and caching strategies to minimize API calls
   - Use pagination for leaderboards and friend lists to handle large datasets

10. Error Handling and Edge Cases:
    - Implement robust error handling for network issues and data inconsistencies
    - Handle edge cases such as blocked users, deleted accounts, and data conflicts

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Write tests for all new services (FriendService, LeaderboardService, ComparisonService, etc.)
   - Test edge cases in friend request handling, leaderboard calculations, and message sending

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the interaction between local data management and Firebase backend
   - Verify correct data flow between different social features

3. UI Tests:
   - Implement widget tests for all new UI components
   - Ensure proper rendering and functionality of friend lists, leaderboards, and messaging interfaces

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct beta testing with a small group of users to gather feedback on social features
   - Test the app with different network conditions to ensure smooth performance

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize load times for social feature screens
   - Test the app's performance with a large number of friends and leaderboard entries

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify that user data is properly protected and only accessible to authorized users
   - Test privacy settings to ensure they correctly limit data visibility

7. Notification Testing:
   - Verify that push notifications are sent and received correctly for various social interactions

8. Cross-device Testing:
   - Ensure consistent functionality and appearance across different device types and screen sizes

9. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that the implementation of social features does not negatively impact existing app functionality

10. Localization Testing:
    - Test all new UI elements and messages with multiple languages to ensure proper localization
