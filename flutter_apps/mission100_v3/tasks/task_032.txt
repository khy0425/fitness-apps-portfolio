# Task ID: 32
# Title: Task #32: Add Bottom Banner Advertisement to Home/Splash Screen with Language Toggle Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a bottom banner advertisement on the home/splash screen that displays naturally whenever users launch the app, maximizing ad revenue while ensuring harmonious placement with the language toggle button.
# Details:
1. Design and implement a non-intrusive banner advertisement container at the bottom of the home/splash screen.
2. Integrate with the existing ad network provider (likely AdMob based on previous tasks).
3. Configure the ad to load immediately when the app launches to maximize impression opportunities.
4. Ensure the banner placement doesn't interfere with critical UI elements, especially the language toggle button.
5. Implement responsive design to accommodate different screen sizes:
   - For smaller screens: Ensure minimum height for the ad while maintaining visibility of all UI elements
   - For larger screens: Optimize ad placement for aesthetic balance
6. Add proper padding/margins around the banner to maintain visual harmony with existing UI elements.
7. Implement ad refresh logic to periodically reload new advertisements (recommended every 60 seconds).
8. Handle ad loading failures gracefully - if an ad fails to load, the space should collapse or be filled with a placeholder.
9. Ensure the language toggle button remains fully functional and visually prominent despite the new ad placement.
10. Add analytics tracking to monitor ad performance metrics (impressions, clicks, revenue).
11. Implement A/B testing capability to compare different ad placements and their impact on user engagement.
12. Optimize ad loading to minimize impact on app startup time and overall performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify the banner ad appears correctly on app launch across multiple device types and screen sizes
   - Confirm the ad loads properly in both online and offline scenarios (showing appropriate fallbacks when offline)
   - Test that the language toggle button remains fully functional with the new ad placement
   - Verify ad refresh functionality works as expected at the configured intervals

2. Performance Testing:
   - Measure app launch time before and after implementation to ensure minimal impact
   - Monitor memory usage to confirm the ad implementation doesn't cause memory leaks
   - Test on low-end devices to ensure performance remains acceptable

3. Visual/UI Testing:
   - Verify the banner ad and language toggle button are visually harmonious on all supported screen sizes
   - Confirm proper rendering in both light and dark themes (if applicable)
   - Ensure no UI elements overlap or get cut off with the new ad placement

4. User Experience Testing:
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the ad placement and its impact on overall experience
   - Verify the ad doesn't obstruct important content or functionality
   - Test accessibility features to ensure the app remains usable with screen readers and other assistive technologies

5. Revenue Verification:
   - Confirm ad impressions are being properly counted in the ad network dashboard
   - Verify click-through functionality works correctly
   - Monitor revenue metrics to ensure the implementation is generating expected income

6. Compliance Testing:
   - Verify the implementation complies with ad network policies and guidelines
   - Ensure proper consent mechanisms are in place for regions with specific privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
