# Title: Task #30: Implement Auto-Loop Functionality for Tutorial Videos
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add automatic loop functionality to tutorial videos in shorts format by enabling the loop setting in YoutubePlayerController, ensuring videos replay continuously to improve the user learning experience.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the YoutubePlayerController to enable automatic looping of tutorial videos. Implementation steps include:

1. Identify all instances where the YoutubePlayerController is initialized for tutorial videos, particularly in shorts format.
2. Add a configuration parameter to enable looping functionality (player.setLoop(true)) for these specific tutorial videos.
3. Ensure the looping behavior only applies to tutorial videos in shorts format, not to regular longer-form content.
4. Add a visual indicator to show users that the video is in loop mode (small loop icon in the player UI).
5. Consider adding a toggle button to allow users to disable looping if desired.
6. Update the player state management to handle the loop state correctly when users navigate away and return to the tutorial.
7. Optimize the transition between loop iterations to be seamless without visible buffering.
8. Ensure this feature works consistently across different device types and orientations.
9. Maintain compatibility with the existing ad integration from Task #29.
10. Document the changes in the codebase for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the loop functionality works correctly and enhances user experience:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the YoutubePlayerController configuration to ensure loop parameter is set correctly.
   - Verify state management handles loop settings appropriately.

2. Integration Tests:
   - Confirm videos automatically restart after completion without user intervention.
   - Test the interaction between looping and other player controls (pause, seek, etc.).
   - Verify loop functionality works with different video lengths and formats.

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Ensure any loop indicators or controls are clearly visible and intuitive.
   - Test the seamlessness of the loop transition (no jarring cuts or buffering).

4. Cross-device Testing:
   - Verify functionality on different screen sizes and orientations.
   - Test on both Android and iOS platforms.

5. Performance Testing:
   - Monitor memory usage during extended looping sessions.
   - Check for any performance degradation after multiple loop cycles.

6. Ad Integration Testing:
   - Confirm that looping doesn't interfere with ad display from Task #29.
   - Test that ads appear at appropriate intervals even with looping enabled.

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Gather feedback on whether the looping enhances learning experience.
   - Test with actual users to ensure the feature meets their needs.
