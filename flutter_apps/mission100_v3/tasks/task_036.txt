# Title: Task #36: Implement Calendar View for Daily Workout Completion Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a calendar screen that visually displays the user's daily workout completion status using the table_calendar package, allowing users to track their exercise consistency over time.
# Details:
1. Create a new Calendar tab in the main navigation menu.
2. Implement the calendar view using the table_calendar Flutter package.
3. Design a marking system to visually indicate completed workout days:
   - Use distinct colors or icons to represent different completion statuses (completed, partially completed, missed).
   - Ensure the marking is visually clear and consistent with the app's design language.
4. Implement data persistence for workout completion records:
   - Create a data model for storing workout completion dates.
   - Implement methods to save workout completion status to local storage when a workout is finished.
   - Develop functions to retrieve and display historical workout data on the calendar.
5. Add functionality to view workout details when tapping on a specific date:
   - Show a summary of exercises completed on that day.
   - Display relevant statistics (duration, calories burned, etc.).
6. Ensure the calendar UI is responsive and works across different device sizes.
7. Implement proper state management to update the calendar when new workouts are completed.
8. Add animations for calendar interactions to enhance user experience.
9. Ensure the implementation follows the existing app design patterns and color schemes.
10. Optimize performance for loading and displaying large datasets of historical workout information.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test data persistence functions for saving and retrieving workout completion data.
   - Verify the logic for determining workout completion status.
   - Test date handling and calendar navigation functions.

2. Widget Testing:
   - Test the calendar widget renders correctly with different datasets.
   - Verify marking system displays correctly for various workout statuses.
   - Test interactions with calendar dates (tapping, scrolling, changing months).

3. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the calendar updates correctly when a new workout is completed.
   - Test navigation between the calendar tab and other app sections.
   - Ensure workout details display correctly when a date is selected.

4. Manual Testing:
   - Verify visual appearance across different device sizes and orientations.
   - Check that the calendar markings are visually distinct and intuitive.
   - Test the user flow from completing a workout to seeing it reflected on the calendar.
   - Verify month navigation and year selection work smoothly.
   - Test edge cases such as leap years, month transitions, and different time zones.

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize loading time for the calendar with large datasets.
   - Test scrolling performance and responsiveness of the calendar view.
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits when viewing extended time periods.
